Very poetic, insightful.

##3⭐ [The War of the Worlds by H. G. Wells [Free]](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-g-wells/the-war-of-the-worlds)
*finished* *2020/01/25*

Nice ending twist, this would be more amazing 100 years ago.

##4⭐ [The Invisible Man by H. G. Wells [Free]](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-g-wells/the-invisible-man)

##2⭐ [Armageddon 2419 A.D. by Philip Francis Nowlan [Free]](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/philip-francis-nowlan/armageddon-2419-a-d)
*finished* *2020/01/20*

Nothing's special.

##3⭐ [Homo Deus by Yuval Noah Harari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_Deus:_A_Brief_History_of_Tomorrow)
*finished* *2020/04/11*

The first half is repeatitive things from `Sapien` book - which is sure 5/5. The remaining discusses religions such as liberalism, communism, democracy, humanism, dataism and list out future scenarious are more interesting.

##3⭐ [The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain [Free]](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/mark-twain/the-adventures-of-huckleberry-finn)
*finished* *2020/04/12*

A kid story, not so interesting until the very end.

##2⭐ [Heart of darkness by Joseph Conrad [Free]](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/joseph-conrad/heart-of-darkness)
*finished* *2020/04/19*

Very dense, hard to read/grasp the meanings. Maybe read later.

##4⭐ [The Black Swan -  The Impact of the Highly Improbable by Nassim Nicholas Taleb]()
*finished* *2020/06/20*

A mind changing book, a eye-opening way to reason about life that it is unpredictable, and how was it much harder to look back and find cause than guessing future.

##4.5⭐ [Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban by J. K. Rowling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban)
*finished* *2020/08/16*

My first ever book in Harry Potter series. I expected much more as known this as top rated sci-fi series in human history. A bit boring at first half but becomes better toward the end. Except the very end part, the whole story is pretty "dry", emotionless.  I was amazed how easy is it to read this whole book without a single time looking up word in dictionary. Finished in about 8 hours, spreading 4 days, it is good enough for 4.5/5.

##5⭐ [Sự im lặng của bầy cừu by Thomas Harris]()
*finished* *2020/08/31*

Trilled, attractive.

##3⭐ [Great Expectations by Charles Dickens [Free]](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-dickens/great-expectations)
